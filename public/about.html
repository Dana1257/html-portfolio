        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I am a beginner at coding. I am studying on my own and so far I am really enjoying it. I really like that in coding there is always something new to learn. I also like that coding involves both creativity and logic. I hope to one day apply all I learn to make my own designs and webpages. It seems that with coding the possibilities are endless. I like seeing how the look of my page changes when I am writing the code.
I am always looking forward to what comes next as I progress. I took coding lessons on Free Code Camp and I am constantly looking for videos and articles on coding just so I can learn more. I got a book from Amazon just for beginners, and I will probably use it throughout my career. I also search Eventbrite for workshops and classes on coding. After all it's always great to learn something new about a topic that is of interest.
I really enjoy being part of the information age. I think that the internet is one of the world's greatest inventions. I always liked research and I consider myself to be a very curious person. I like that if I have a quick question I can quickly search on Google and find the answers within minutes. I like the idea that information is everywhere. Including the palm of our hands. I like that the internet is about connectiveness, information, and education. I can't imagine what the world would be like without the internet. In fact it's hard to remember a time before the Internet.</p>

<h2>Where I'm From</h2>
<p>I am originally from the suburbs of Thornhill, Ontario. I have recently moved out of the suburbs and I am enjoying the more urban lifestyle; although I still have a spectacular view of the suburbs. There is something really magical about watching the sunset every evening. In the summer I get to see all the greenery; and in the wintertime I get to watch the snow falling down as it creates a white blanket underneath me. </p>

<h2>More About Me</h2>
<h3>What are your favourite hobbies?</h3>
<p>My hobbies include puzzles, crafts, and watching movies. I specifically enjoy doing sudoku puzzles, not just the regular sudokus but also sudoku varients. I think that my enjoyment of solving problems has a lot to with why I enjoy coding. When I work on craft projects I get to be in a state of flow and completely immersed. It's like everything else disappears and all that stays is just me and the project that I am working on. I like watching drama and comedies, but overall, I like a story that has me wondering "what will happen next".</p>

<h3>What is your dream job?</h3>
<p>I'd like to work in a job that involves problem solving and something that allows me to make the most of my strengths. Hopefully that job will involve coding and/or technology. I would also like a job that will allow me to keep on learning new skills.</p>

<h3>What's your background?</h3>
<p>I have a degree in Honours Psychology from York University and a Library and Information Technician Diploma from Seneca College. I only got into coding because my brother suggested it because he realized that coding goes well with my strengths.</p>

<h3>What music have you been listening to lately?</h3>
<p>Pop music is what's playing on my radio. However in the past I liked to listen to oldies, but now I just find myself wanting to listen to upbeat music or songs that tell a story.</p>
